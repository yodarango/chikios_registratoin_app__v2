# TO DO:

- add a phone number clean up function in the BE so that the <a tel:#></a> can direct the user dierctly to their messaging application
- A parent can have up to 4 kids. It makes no sense for them to enter the guardian info all over again for each child. Make the child and parent values a filterable dropdown when a new child is being registered so that the name of the parent can be registered.
- integrate a text message service to text parents the code automatically
- check the css and make it behave properly with all my other apps
- leave this app running and include it in my portafolio but make it suitable for it before
- clean the code a bit
- integrate a printer for automatic label printing with the child names
- build a graph to look at a overall picture over the years
- add a tracker to watch all the kids that have been to the bathroom and limit their exiting
